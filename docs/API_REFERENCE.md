# API Reference

This document describes the REST API provided by the Cielo Azure Billing project.

## Authentication

The API uses token authentication via Django REST Framework. When the setting `API_AUTH_DISABLED` is `True`, authentication is skipped and all endpoints are public. Otherwise a token is required.

## Endpoints

### CostReportSnapshot
- **Base path**: `/api/snapshots/`
- Standard CRUD operations are available.
- A snapshot represents a single imported cost CSV file and includes fields such as `run_id`, `report_date` and `status`.

### Customer
- **Base path**: `/api/customers/`
- Manage Azure tenants that own subscriptions.

### Subscription
- **Base path**: `/api/subscriptions/`
- Each subscription belongs to a customer and can be filtered in the cost endpoints.

### Resource
- **Base path**: `/api/resources/`
- Represents an Azure resource referenced in cost reports.

### Meter
- **Base path**: `/api/meters/`
- Lookup table for meter metadata used by billing entries.

### CostEntry
- **Base path**: `/api/cost-entries/`
- Lists imported billing line items. When the query parameter `date` is provided the view resolves the most recent snapshot that includes that billing date.
- Supports filtering by subscription, resource group, meter category and more. See `docs/CostsFilteringGuide.md` for details.
- The endpoint also exposes an `aggregate/` action. Provide one or more `group_by` parameters (e.g. `resourceGroupName`, `subscriptionName`) to receive aggregated totals in USD.

### Subscription Summary
- **Path**: `/api/costs/subscription-summary/`
- Returns aggregated costs grouped by subscription. Accepts the common filtering parameters.

### Virtual Machines Summary
- **Path**: `/api/costs/virtual-machines-summary/`
- Same as the subscription summary but automatically filters by `meter_category=Virtual Machines`.

### Resource Group Summary
- **Path**: `/api/costs/resource-group-summary/`
- Aggregates costs by resource group.

### Meter Category Summary
- **Path**: `/api/costs/meter-category-summary/`
- Aggregates costs by top level meter category (e.g. compute or storage).

### Region Summary
- **Path**: `/api/costs/region-summary/`
- Aggregates costs by Azure region.

### Resource Group Totals
- **Path**: `/api/costs/resource-group-totals/`
- Requires `resource_group` parameter. Returns total cost per resource inside that group.

### Available Report Dates
- **Path**: `/api/costs/available-report-dates/`
- Returns billing dates that exist for a specified month (defaults to the current month).

### Snapshot Report Dates
- **Path**: `/api/snapshots/available-report-dates/`
- Lists `report_date` values from completed snapshots. These dates can be used with the summary endpoints.

## How Cost Summaries Are Calculated

All summary endpoints inherit from `BaseSummaryView` located in `billing/views.py`. The `get` method performs the following steps:

1. Resolve the latest completed `CostReportSnapshot` for each active `BillingBlobSource` using `get_latest_snapshots()`.
2. Filter `CostEntry` rows to include only those snapshots (and the requested billing date if provided).
3. Apply additional filters based on the query parameters.
4. Group the remaining entries by the configured fields and sum `cost_in_usd` and `cost_in_billing_currency`.
5. Cache the result for subsequent requests.

The relevant implementation is shown below:

```python
# billing/views.py
class BaseSummaryView(APIView):
    ...
    def get(self, request):
        cache = get_cache_backend()
        date_str = request.GET.get('date')
        ...
        snapshots, missing = get_latest_snapshots(date)
        queryset = CostEntry.objects.filter(snapshot_id__in=[s.id for s in snapshots])
        if date:
            queryset = queryset.filter(date=date)
        filterset = self.filterset_class(request.GET, queryset=queryset)
        data = (
            filterset.qs
            .annotate(**{f"_{k}": v for k, v in self.group_by.items()})
            .values(*[f"_{k}" for k in self.group_by])
            .annotate(
                total_usd=Sum('cost_in_usd'),
                total_billing=Sum('cost_in_billing_currency'),
            )
            .order_by()
        )
```

Snapshots are selected through the helper function:

```python
# billing/utils.py
def get_latest_snapshots(date=None):
    snapshots = []
    missing = []
    for source in BillingBlobSource.objects.filter(is_active=True):
        qs = CostReportSnapshot.objects.filter(
            source=source,
            status=CostReportSnapshot.Status.COMPLETE,
        )
        if date:
            qs = qs.filter(costentry__date=date)
        snap = qs.order_by('-created_at').first()
        if snap:
            snapshots.append(snap)
        else:
            reason = 'no snapshot for date' if date else 'no snapshot'
            missing.append({'name': source.name, 'reason': reason})
    return snapshots, missing
```

The API response from a summary endpoint includes the date used, counts of sources included or missing and the aggregated data list.
