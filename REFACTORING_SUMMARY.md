# BillingBlobSource Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Azure billing blob functionality from management commands into the `BillingBlobSource` model to improve code organization and reusability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced BillingBlobSource Model (`billing/models.py`)

Added the following static and instance methods to centralize Azure blob operations:

#### Static Methods:
- `parse_base_folder(base)` - Parse base folder URL into container URL and prefix
- `format_bytes(size_bytes)` - Convert bytes to human readable format

#### Instance Methods:
- `get_azure_client()` - Get Azure container client for this blob source
- `list_blobs(billing_period=None)` - List all blobs, optionally filtered by billing period
- `get_manifests(billing_period=None)` - Get all manifest files for this source
- `get_manifest_data(manifest_blob, container_url)` - Download and parse manifest data
- `download_csv_blob(manifest_data, container_url)` - Download CSV blob from manifest data
- `process_import_run(manifest_blob, container_url, dry_run=False, overwrite=False)` - Process a single import run
- `fetch_and_import(billing_period=None, dry_run=False, overwrite=False)` - Fetch and import all available runs
- `inspect_available_runs(billing_period=None)` - Inspect available export runs without importing

### 2. Simplified Management Commands

#### `fetch_and_import_from_blob.py`
- Reduced from 330 lines to 159 lines (52% reduction)
- Removed all Azure SDK imports and blob handling logic
- Now uses `source.fetch_and_import()` method
- Maintains the same CLI interface and output formatting
- Simplified error handling and statistics tracking

#### `inspect_blob_source.py`
- Reduced from 418 lines to 192 lines (54% reduction)
- Removed all Azure SDK imports and blob handling logic
- Now uses `source.inspect_available_runs()` method
- Maintains the same CLI interface and output formatting
- Simplified inspection logic

### 3. Benefits Achieved

#### Code Organization:
- **Single Responsibility**: Model handles Azure operations, commands handle CLI interface
- **Reusability**: Azure functionality can now be used by other parts of the application
- **Maintainability**: Centralized blob operations in one place
- **Testability**: Model methods can be unit tested independently

#### Reduced Complexity:
- **52-54% code reduction** in management commands
- Eliminated duplicate Azure SDK initialization code
- Simplified error handling patterns
- Cleaner separation of concerns

#### Enhanced Functionality:
- Model methods return structured data for programmatic use
- Better error handling with proper exception propagation
- Consistent logging across all operations
- Flexible parameter handling

### 4. Preserved Features

All original functionality is maintained:
- ✅ CLI argument parsing (--billing-period, --only, --dry-run, --overwrite)
- ✅ Formatted console output with emojis and colors
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ Statistics tracking and final reports
- ✅ Azure SDK error handling
- ✅ Billing period filtering
- ✅ Manifest processing and CSV import

### 5. Usage Examples

#### Using the Model Methods Directly:
```python
# Get a billing source
source = BillingBlobSource.objects.get(name='prod-billing')

# Fetch and import all runs
result = source.fetch_and_import(dry_run=True)
print(f"Found {result['manifests_found']} manifests")

# Inspect available runs
inspection = source.inspect_available_runs(billing_period='20250501-20250531')
print(f"Total runs: {len(inspection['runs_data'])}")
```

#### Using the CLI Commands (unchanged):
```bash
# Fetch and import
python manage.py fetch_and_import_from_blob --billing-period 20250501-20250531 --dry-run

# Inspect source
python manage.py inspect_blob_source --source-name prod-billing
```

### 6. Files Modified

- ✅ `billing/models.py` - Added Azure blob functionality methods
- ✅ `billing/management/commands/fetch_and_import_from_blob.py` - Simplified to use model methods
- ✅ `billing/management/commands/inspect_blob_source.py` - Simplified to use model methods

### 7. Testing Status

- ✅ All files compile without errors
- ✅ Django recognizes both management commands
- ✅ Help output works correctly for both commands
- ✅ Model methods are properly structured with error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Write Unit Tests**: Create tests for the new model methods
2. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual Azure blob sources
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to include new model methods
4. **Consider Further Refactoring**: Could extract Azure operations into a separate service class if needed

## Migration Path

The refactoring is backward compatible:
- Existing scripts using the management commands will continue to work unchanged
- New code can leverage the model methods directly for programmatic access
- Old backup files are preserved (`*_old.py`) for reference
